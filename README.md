# Cloud autoMate

Cloud autoMate is a web service designed to simplify the process of creating and deploying various cloud services. With just a few simple steps, users can deploy multiple virtual machines (VMs) with custom requirements from their own cloud accounts, all without the need for manual input.

## Project Description

The primary objective of Cloud autoMate is to provide a user-friendly platform for deploying cloud resources, focusing initially on Microsoft Azure. The project accomplishes this through a combination of server-side predefined workflows for custom VMs and a dictionary-like interface for users to select and deploy the VMs. This approach streamlines the deployment process and empowers users to quickly provision the resources they need.

- A Virtual Machine with terminal access (Minimum configuration: 2 GB RAM)
